# Intro

In this example, we will see how to use Basic angular concepts, such how to create components, how to pass parameters from one component to another, how to to data binding between the controllers and the view (template), how to create events.



# demos


This example is composed for several small demonstrations.

For a small demo, it is created in a single file (controller + template in a single file), because it is easier to read.

Theses demos can be adapted to create small test/ exercises.
