# Intro

In this example, we will see how to use Basic angular concepts, such how to create components, how to pass parameters, how to to data binding between the controllers and the view (template).



# demos


This example is composed for several small démonstrations.
Each démo is created in a single file (controller + template in a single file), because it is easier to read.

Theses demos are useful for beig adapted to create small test/ POC (proof of concepts).
